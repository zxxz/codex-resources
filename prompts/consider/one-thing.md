argument-hint: [goal or leave blank for current context]
---

<objective>
Apply "The One Thing" framework to $ARGUMENTS (or the current discussion if no arguments provided).

Ask: "What's the ONE thing I can do such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?"
</objective>

<process>
1. Clarify the ultimate goal or desired outcome
2. List all possible actions that could contribute
3. For each action, ask: "Does this make other things easier or unnecessary?"
4. Identify the domino that knocks down others
5. Define the specific next action for that one thing
</process>

<output_format>
**Goal:** [what you're trying to achieve]

**Candidate Actions:**
- Action 1: [downstream effect]
- Action 2: [downstream effect]
- Action 3: [downstream effect]

**The One Thing:**
[The action that enables or eliminates the most other actions]

**Why This One:**
By doing this, [specific things] become easier or unnecessary because...

**Next Action:**
[Specific, concrete first step to take right now]
</output_format>

<success_criteria>
- Identifies genuine leverage point, not just important task
- Shows causal chain (this enables that)
- Reduces overwhelm to single focus
- Next action is immediately actionable
- Everything else can wait until this is done
</success_criteria>
