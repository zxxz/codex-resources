description: Apply Eisenhower matrix (urgent/important) to prioritize tasks or decisions
argument-hint: [tasks or leave blank for current context]
---

<objective>
Apply the Eisenhower matrix to $ARGUMENTS (or the current discussion if no arguments provided).

Categorize items by urgency and importance to clarify what to do now, schedule, delegate, or eliminate.
</objective>

<process>
1. List all tasks, decisions, or items in scope
2. Evaluate each on two axes:
   - Important: Contributes to long-term goals/values
   - Urgent: Requires immediate attention, has deadline pressure
3. Place each item in appropriate quadrant
4. Provide specific action for each quadrant
</process>

<output_format>
**Q1: Do First** (Important + Urgent)
- Item: [specific action, deadline if applicable]

**Q2: Schedule** (Important + Not Urgent)
- Item: [when to do it, why it matters long-term]

**Q3: Delegate** (Not Important + Urgent)
- Item: [who/what can handle it, or how to minimize time spent]

**Q4: Eliminate** (Not Important + Not Urgent)
- Item: [why it's noise, permission to drop it]

**Immediate Focus:**
Single sentence on what to tackle right now.
</output_format>

<success_criteria>
- Every item clearly placed in one quadrant
- Q1 items have specific next actions
- Q2 items have scheduling recommendations
- Q3 items have delegation or minimization strategies
- Q4 items explicitly marked as droppable
- Reduces overwhelm by creating clear action hierarchy
</success_criteria>
