argument-hint: [decision or leave blank for current context]
---

<objective>
Apply the 10/10/10 rule to $ARGUMENTS (or the current discussion if no arguments provided).

Ask: "How will I feel about this decision in 10 minutes, 10 months, and 10 years?"
</objective>

<process>
1. State the decision clearly with options
2. For each option, evaluate emotional and practical impact at:
   - 10 minutes (immediate reaction)
   - 10 months (medium-term consequences)
   - 10 years (long-term life impact)
3. Identify where short-term and long-term conflict
4. Make recommendation based on time-weighted analysis
</process>

<output_format>
**Decision:** [what you're choosing between]

**Option A:**
- 10 minutes: [immediate feeling/consequence]
- 10 months: [medium-term reality]
- 10 years: [long-term impact on life]

**Option B:**
- 10 minutes: [immediate feeling/consequence]
- 10 months: [medium-term reality]
- 10 years: [long-term impact on life]

**Time Conflicts:**
[Where short-term pain leads to long-term gain, or vice versa]

**Recommendation:**
[Which option, weighted toward longer time horizons]
