<objective>
Apply Pareto's principle to $ARGUMENTS (or the current discussion if no arguments provided).

Identify the vital few factors (≈20%) that drive the majority of results (≈80%), cutting through noise to focus on what actually matters.
</objective>

<process>
1. Identify all factors, options, tasks, or considerations in scope
2. Estimate relative impact of each factor on the desired outcome
3. Rank by impact (highest to lowest)
4. Identify the cutoff where ~20% of factors account for ~80% of impact
5. Present the vital few with specific, actionable recommendations
6. Note what can be deprioritized or ignored
</process>

<output_format>
**Vital Few (focus here):**
- Factor 1: [why it matters, specific action]
- Factor 2: [why it matters, specific action]
- Factor 3: [why it matters, specific action]

**Trivial Many (deprioritize):**
- Brief list of what can be deferred or ignored

**Bottom Line:**
Single sentence on where to focus effort for maximum results.
</output_format>

<success_criteria>
- Clearly separates high-impact from low-impact factors
- Provides specific, actionable recommendations for vital few
- Explains why each vital factor matters
- Gives clear direction on what to ignore or defer
- Reduces decision fatigue by narrowing focus
