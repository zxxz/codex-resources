description: Solve problems backwards - what would guarantee failure?
argument-hint: [goal or leave blank for current context]
---

<objective>
Apply inversion thinking to $ARGUMENTS (or the current discussion if no arguments provided).

Instead of asking "How do I succeed?", ask "What would guarantee failure?" then avoid those things.
</objective>

<process>
1. State the goal or desired outcome
2. Invert: "What would guarantee I fail at this?"
3. List all failure modes (be thorough and honest)
4. For each failure mode, identify the avoidance strategy
5. Build success plan by systematically avoiding failure
</process>

<output_format>
**Goal:** [what success looks like]

**Guaranteed Failure Modes:**
1. [Way to fail]: Avoid by [specific action]
2. [Way to fail]: Avoid by [specific action]
3. [Way to fail]: Avoid by [specific action]

**Anti-Goals (Never Do):**
- [Behavior to eliminate]
- [Behavior to eliminate]

**Success By Avoidance:**
By simply not doing [X, Y, Z], success becomes much more likely because...

**Remaining Risk:**
[What's left after avoiding obvious failures]
</output_format>

<success_criteria>
- Failure modes are specific and realistic
- Avoidance strategies are actionable
- Surfaces risks that optimistic planning misses
- Creates clear "never do" boundaries
- Shows path to success via negativa
</success_criteria>
