Verified patterns from official Codex documentation.

## Git Workflow Patterns

### Pattern: Commit with Full Context

**Source**: Official Codex documentation

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
description: Create a git commit
---

<objective>
Create a git commit for current changes following repository conventions.
</objective>

<context>
- Current git status: ! `git status`

- Current branch: ! `git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: ! `git log --oneline -10`
</context>

<process>
1. Review staged and unstaged changes

---

<objective>
Review the implementation in @ $ARGUMENTS.

This allows flexible file review based on user specification.
</objective>

## Thinking-Only Patterns

### Pattern: Deep Analysis

```markdown
---
description: Analyze problem from first principles
allowed-tools: SequentialThinking
---

<objective>
Analyze the current problem from first principles.

This helps discover optimal solutions by stripping away assumptions and rebuilding from fundamental truths.
</objective>

<process>
1. Identify the core problem
2. Strip away all assumptions

- Novel insights discovered
</success_criteria>
```

Tool restriction ensures Codex only uses SequentialThinking.

### Pattern: Strategic Planning

```markdown

- Optimal approach identified
- Risks and mitigations outlined
</success_criteria>
```

## Bash Execution Patterns

### Pattern: Dynamic Environment Loading

```markdown
---
description: Check project status
---

<objective>
Provide a comprehensive project health summary.

This helps understand current project state across git, dependencies, and tests.
</objective>

<context>
- Git: ! `git status --short`
- Node: ! `npm list --depth=0 2>/dev/null | head -20`
- Tests: ! `npm test -- --listTests 2>/dev/null | wc -l`
</context>

<process>
1. Analyze git status for uncommitted changes
2. Review npm dependencies for issues
3. Check test coverage
4. Identify potential problems
5. Provide actionable recommendations
</process>

<success_criteria>
- All metrics checked
- Current state clearly described
- Issues identified
- Recommendations provided
</success_criteria>
```

Multiple bash commands load environment state.

### Pattern: Conditional Execution

```markdown
---
description: Deploy if tests pass
allowed-tools: Bash(npm test:*), Bash(npm run deploy:*)
---

<objective>
Deploy to production only if all tests pass.

This ensures deployment safety through automated testing gates.
</objective>

<context>
Test results: ! `npm test`
</context>

<process>
1. Review test results
2. If all tests passed, proceed to deployment
3. If any tests failed, report failures and abort
4. Monitor deployment process
5. Confirm successful deployment
</process>

<success_criteria>
- All tests verified passing
- Deployment executed only on test success
- Deployment confirmed successful
- Or deployment aborted with clear failure reasons
</success_criteria>
```

## Multi-Step Workflow Patterns

### Pattern: Structured Workflow

```markdown
---
description: Complete feature development workflow
argument-hint: [feature description]
---

<objective>

4. **Completion**
   - Create commit
   - Write PR description
</process>

<testing>
- Run tests: ! `npm test`
- Check lint: ! `npm run lint`
</testing>

<verification>
Before completing:
- All tests passing
- No lint errors
- Documentation updated

```

## Command Chaining Patterns

### Pattern: Analysis → Action

```markdown
---
description: Analyze and fix performance issues
argument-hint: [file-path]
---

<objective>
Analyze and fix performance issues in @ $ARGUMENTS.

This provides end-to-end performance improvement from analysis through verification.
</objective>

<process>
1. Analyze @ $ARGUMENTS for performance issues
2. Identify top 3 most impactful optimizations
3. Implement the optimizations
4. Verify improvements with benchmarks
</process>

<verification>
Before completing:
- Benchmarks run showing performance improvement
- No functionality regressions
- Code quality maintained
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Performance issues identified and fixed
- Measurable performance improvement
- Benchmarks confirm gains
- No regressions introduced
</success_criteria>
```

Sequential steps in single command.

## Tool Restriction Patterns

### Pattern: Git-Only Command

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git diff:*), Bash(git commit:*)
description: Git workflow command
---

<objective>
Perform git operations safely with tool restrictions.

This prevents running arbitrary bash commands while allowing necessary git operations.
</objective>

<context>
Current git state: ! `git status`
</context>

<process>
1. Review git status
2. Perform git operations
3. Verify changes
</process>

<success_criteria>
- Git operations completed successfully
- No arbitrary commands executed
- Repository state as expected
</success_criteria>
```

Prevents running non-git bash commands.

### Pattern: Read-Only Analysis

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: [Read, Grep, Glob]
description: Analyze codebase
argument-hint: [search pattern]
---

<objective>
Search codebase for pattern: $ARGUMENTS

This provides safe codebase analysis without modification or execution permissions.
</objective>

<process>
1. Use Grep to search for pattern across codebase
2. Analyze findings
3. Identify relevant files and code sections
4. Provide summary of results
</process>

<success_criteria>
- Pattern search completed
- All matches identified
- Relevant context provided
- No files modified
</success_criteria>
```

No write or execution permissions.

### Pattern: Specific Bash Commands

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(npm test:*), Bash(npm run lint:*)
description: Run project checks
---

<objective>
Run project quality checks (tests and linting).

This ensures code quality while restricting to specific npm scripts.
</objective>

<testing>
Tests: ! `npm test`
Lint: ! `npm run lint`
</testing>

<process>
1. Run tests and capture results
2. Run linting and capture results
3. Analyze both outputs
4. Report on pass/fail status
5. Provide specific failure details if any
</process>

<success_criteria>
- All tests passing
- No lint errors
- Clear report of results
- Or specific failures identified with details
</success_criteria>
```

Only allows specific npm scripts.

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Tool Restrictions for Safety

```yaml
# Git commands
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*)

# Analysis only
allowed-tools: [Read, Grep, Glob]

# Thinking only
allowed-tools: SequentialThinking
```

### 2. Load Dynamic Context When Needed

```markdown
Current state: ! `git status`
Recent activity: ! `git log --oneline -5`
```

### 3. Reference Files Explicitly

```markdown
Review @ package.json for dependencies
Check @ src/config/* for settings
```

### 4. Structure Complex Commands

```markdown
## Step 1: Analysis
[analysis prompt]

## Step 2: Implementation
[implementation prompt]

## Step 3: Verification
[verification prompt]
```

### 5. Use Arguments for Flexibility

```markdown
# Simple
Fix issue #$ARGUMENTS

# Positional
Review PR #$1 with priority $2

# File reference
Analyze @ $ARGUMENTS
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ No Description

```yaml
---
# Missing description field
---
```

### ❌ Overly Broad Tool Access

```yaml
# Git command with no restrictions
---
description: Create commit
---
```

Better:
```yaml
---
description: Create commit
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
---
```

### ❌ Vague Instructions

```markdown
Do the thing for $ARGUMENTS
```

Better:
```markdown
Fix issue #$ARGUMENTS by:
1. Understanding the issue
2. Locating relevant code
3. Implementing solution
4. Adding tests
```

### ❌ Missing Context for State-Dependent Tasks

```markdown
Create a git commit
```

Better:
```markdown
Current changes: ! `git status`
Diff: ! `git diff`

Create a git commit for these changes
```
