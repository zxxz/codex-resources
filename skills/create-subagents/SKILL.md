description: Guidance for emulating subagents in Codex via MCP orchestration. Codex does not provide native subagents; use this when wiring command-driven Codex sessions with role-specific AGENTS.*.md configs.
---

<objective>
Codex does not currently support Claude-style subagents. You can approximate them by running Codex as an MCP server and launching role-specific sessions (e.g., `AGENTS.ux-designer.md`) via scripts or automation commands. This skill covers how to structure those role configs and invoke them safely.
</objective>

<quick_start>
<workflow>
1. Create a role config file such as `AGENTS.ux-designer.md` with the system prompt and guardrails.
2. Add a shell script that launches Codex as an MCP server with that config (e.g., `./scripts/run-ux-designer.sh`).
3. Call the script from your orchestrator/CLI when you need the specialized viewpoint.
4. Pipe outputs back into the main conversation manually or via your automation layer.
</workflow>

name: code-reviewer
description: Expert code reviewer. Use proactively after code changes to review for quality, security, and best practices.
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
model: sonnet
---

<role>
You are a senior code reviewer focused on quality, security, and best practices.
</role>

<focus_areas>
- Code quality and maintainability
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Best practices adherence
</focus_areas>

<output_format>
Provide specific, actionable feedback with file:line references.
</output_format>
```
</example>
</quick_start>

<file_structure>
| Type | Location | Scope | Priority |
|------|----------|-------|----------|
| **Project** | `.codex/agents/` or `AGENTS.*.md` in repo | Current project only | Highest |
| **User** | `~/.codex/agents/` | All projects | Lower |

Project-level role configs override user-level when names conflict.
</file_structure>

<configuration>
<field name="name">
- Lowercase letters and hyphens only
- Must be unique
</field>

<field name="description">
- Natural language description of purpose
- Include when Codex should invoke this subagent
- Used for automatic subagent selection
</field>

<field name="tools">
- Comma-separated list: `Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep`
- If omitted: inherits all tools from main thread
- Use `/agents` interface to see all available tools
</field>

<field name="model">
- `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, or `inherit`
- `inherit`: uses same model as main conversation
- If omitted: defaults to configured subagent model (usually sonnet)
</field>
</configuration>

<execution_model>
<critical_constraint>
**Subagents are black boxes that cannot interact with users.**

Subagents run in isolated contexts and return their final output to the main conversation. They:
- ✅ Can use tools like Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob
- ✅ Can access MCP servers and other non-interactive tools
- ❌ **Cannot use AskUserQuestion** or any tool requiring user interaction
- ❌ **Cannot present options or wait for user input**
- ❌ **User never sees subagent's intermediate steps**

The main conversation sees only the subagent's final report/output.
</critical_constraint>

<workflow_design>
**Designing workflows with subagents:**

Use **main chat** for:
- Gathering requirements from user (AskUserQuestion)
- Presenting options or decisions to user
- Any task requiring user confirmation/input
- Work where user needs visibility into progress

Use **subagents** for:
- Research tasks (API documentation lookup, code analysis)
- Code generation based on pre-defined requirements
- Analysis and reporting (security review, test coverage)
- Context-heavy operations that don't need user interaction

**Example workflow pattern:**
```
Main Chat: Ask user for requirements (AskUserQuestion)
  ↓
Subagent: Research API and create documentation (no user interaction)
  ↓
Main Chat: Review research with user, confirm approach
  ↓
Subagent: Generate code based on confirmed plan
  ↓
Main Chat: Present results, handle testing/deployment
```
</workflow_design>
</execution_model>

<system_prompt_guidelines>
<principle name="be_specific">
Clearly define the subagent's role, capabilities, and constraints.
</principle>

<principle name="use_pure_xml_structure">
Structure the system prompt with pure XML tags. Remove ALL markdown headings from the body.

```markdown

name: security-reviewer
description: Reviews code for security vulnerabilities
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
model: sonnet

<role>
You are a senior code reviewer specializing in security.
</role>

<focus_areas>
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS attack vectors
- Authentication/authorization issues
- Sensitive data exposure
</focus_areas>

<workflow>
1. Read the modified files
2. Identify security risks
3. Provide specific remediation steps
4. Rate severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
</workflow>
```
</principle>

<principle name="task_specific">
Tailor instructions to the specific task domain. Don't create generic "helper" subagents.

❌ Bad: "You are a helpful assistant that helps with code"
✅ Good: "You are a React component refactoring specialist. Analyze components for hooks best practices, performance anti-patterns, and accessibility issues."
</principle>
</system_prompt_guidelines>

<subagent_xml_structure>
Subagent.md files are system prompts consumed only by Codex. Like skills and slash commands, they should use pure XML structure for optimal parsing and token efficiency.

<recommended_tags>
Common tags for subagent structure:

- `<role>` - Who the subagent is and what it does
- `<constraints>` - Hard rules (NEVER/MUST/ALWAYS)
- `<focus_areas>` - What to prioritize
- `<workflow>` - Step-by-step process
- `<output_format>` - How to structure deliverables
- `<success_criteria>` - Completion criteria
- `<validation>` - How to verify work
</recommended_tags>

<intelligence_rules>
**Simple subagents** (single focused task):
- Use role + constraints + workflow minimum
- Example: code-reviewer, test-runner

**Medium subagents** (multi-step process):
- Add workflow steps, output_format, success_criteria
- Example: api-researcher, documentation-generator

**Complex subagents** (research + generation + validation):
- Add all tags as appropriate including validation, examples
- Example: mcp-api-researcher, comprehensive-auditor
</intelligence_rules>

<critical_rule>
**Remove ALL markdown headings (##, ###) from subagent body.** Use semantic XML tags instead.

Keep markdown formatting WITHIN content (bold, italic, lists, code blocks, links).

For XML structure principles and token efficiency details, see @skills/create-agent-skills/references/use-xml-tags.md - the same principles apply to subagents.
</critical_rule>
</subagent_xml_structure>

<invocation>
<automatic>
Codex automatically selects subagents based on the `description` field when it matches the current task.
</automatic>

<explicit>
You can explicitly invoke a subagent:

```
> Use the code-reviewer subagent to check my recent changes
```

```
> Have the test-writer subagent create tests for the new API endpoints
```
</explicit>
</invocation>

<management>
<using_agents_command>
Run `/agents` for an interactive interface to:
- View all available subagents
- Create new subagents
- Edit existing subagents
- Delete custom subagents
</using_agents_command>

<manual_editing>
You can also edit subagent files directly:
- Project: `.codex/agents/subagent-name.md`
- User: `~/.codex/agents/subagent-name.md`
</manual_editing>
</management>
