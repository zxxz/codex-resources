# Workflow: Execute Phase

<purpose>
Execute a phase prompt (PLAN.md) and create the outcome summary (SUMMARY.md).
</purpose>

<process>

<step name="identify_plan">
Find the next plan to execute:
- Check ROADMAP.md for "In progress" phase
- Find plans in that phase directory
- Identify first plan without corresponding SUMMARY

```bash
cat .planning/ROADMAP.md
# Look for phase with "In progress" status
# Then find plans in that phase
ls .planning/phases/XX-name/*-PLAN.md 2>/dev/null | sort
ls .planning/phases/XX-name/*-SUMMARY.md 2>/dev/null | sort
```

**Logic:**
- If `01-01-PLAN.md` exists but `01-01-SUMMARY.md` doesn't → execute 01-01
- If `01-01-SUMMARY.md` exists but `01-02-SUMMARY.md` doesn't → execute 01-02
- Pattern: Find first PLAN file without matching SUMMARY file

Confirm with user if ambiguous.

Present:
```
Found plan to execute: {phase}-{plan}-PLAN.md
[Plan X of Y for Phase Z]

Proceed with execution?
```
</step>

<step name="parse_segments">
**Intelligent segmentation: Parse plan into execution segments.**

Plans are divided into segments by checkpoints. Each segment is routed to optimal execution context (subagent or main).

**1. Check for checkpoints:**
```bash
# Find all checkpoints and their types
grep -n "type=\"checkpoint" .planning/phases/XX-name/{phase}-{plan}-PLAN.md
```

**2. Analyze execution strategy:**

**If NO checkpoints found:**
- **Fully autonomous plan** - spawn single subagent for entire plan
- Subagent gets fresh 200k context, executes all tasks, creates SUMMARY, commits
- Main context: Just orchestration (~5% usage)

**If checkpoints found, parse into segments:**

Segment = tasks between checkpoints (or start→first checkpoint, or last checkpoint→end)

**For each segment, determine routing:**

```
Segment routing rules:

IF segment has no prior checkpoint:
  → SUBAGENT (first segment, nothing to depend on)

IF segment follows checkpoint:human-verify:
  → SUBAGENT (verification is just confirmation, doesn't affect next work)

IF segment follows checkpoint:decision OR checkpoint:human-action:
  → MAIN CONTEXT (next tasks need the decision/result)
```

**3. Execution pattern:**

**Pattern A: Fully autonomous (no checkpoints)**
```
Spawn subagent → execute all tasks → SUMMARY → commit → report back
```

**Pattern B: Segmented with verify-only checkpoints**
```
Segment 1 (tasks 1-3): Spawn subagent → execute → report back
Checkpoint 4 (human-verify): Main context → you verify → continue
Segment 2 (tasks 5-6): Spawn NEW subagent → execute → report back
Checkpoint 7 (human-verify): Main context → you verify → continue
Aggregate results → SUMMARY → commit
```

**Pattern C: Decision-dependent (must stay in main)**
```
Checkpoint 1 (decision): Main context → you decide → continue in main
Tasks 2-5: Main context (need decision from checkpoint 1)
No segmentation benefit - execute entirely in main
```

**4. Why this works:**

**Segmentation benefits:**
- Fresh context for each autonomous segment (0% start every time)
- Main context only for checkpoints (~10-20% total)
- Can handle 10+ task plans if properly segmented
- Quality impossible to degrade in autonomous segments

**When segmentation provides no benefit:**
- Checkpoint is decision/human-action and following tasks depend on outcome
- Better to execute sequentially in main than break flow

**5. Implementation:**

**For fully autonomous plans:**
```
Use Task tool with subagent_type="general-purpose":

Prompt: "Execute plan at .planning/phases/{phase}-{plan}-PLAN.md

This is an autonomous plan (no checkpoints). Execute all tasks, create SUMMARY.md in phase directory, commit with message following plan's commit guidance.

Follow all deviation rules and authentication gate protocols from the plan.

When complete, report: plan name, tasks completed, SUMMARY path, commit hash."
```

**For segmented plans (has verify-only checkpoints):**
```
Execute segment-by-segment:

For each autonomous segment:
  Spawn subagent with prompt: "Execute tasks [X-Y] from plan at .planning/phases/{phase}-{plan}-PLAN.md. Read the plan for full context and deviation rules. Do NOT create SUMMARY or commit - just execute these tasks and report results."

  Wait for subagent completion

For each checkpoint:
  Execute in main context
  Wait for user interaction
  Continue to next segment

After all segments complete:
  Aggregate all results
  Create SUMMARY.md
  Commit with all changes
```

**For decision-dependent plans:**
```
Execute in main context (standard flow below)
No subagent routing
Quality maintained through small scope (2-3 tasks per plan)
```

See step name="segment_execution" for detailed segment execution loop.
</step>

<step name="segment_execution">
**Detailed segment execution loop for segmented plans.**

**This step applies ONLY to segmented plans (Pattern B: has checkpoints, but they're verify-only).**

For Pattern A (fully autonomous) and Pattern C (decision-dependent), skip this step.

**Execution flow:**

```
1. Parse plan to identify segments:
   - Read plan file
   - Find checkpoint locations: grep -n "type=\"checkpoint" PLAN.md
   - Identify checkpoint types: grep "type=\"checkpoint" PLAN.md | grep -o 'checkpoint:[^"]*'
   - Build segment map:
     * Segment 1: Start → first checkpoint (tasks 1-X)
     * Checkpoint 1: Type and location
     * Segment 2: After checkpoint 1 → next checkpoint (tasks X+1 to Y)
     * Checkpoint 2: Type and location
     * ... continue for all segments

2. For each segment in order:

   A. Determine routing (apply rules from parse_segments):
      - No prior checkpoint? → Subagent
      - Prior checkpoint was human-verify? → Subagent
      - Prior checkpoint was decision/human-action? → Main context

   B. If routing = Subagent:
      ```
      Spawn Task tool with subagent_type="general-purpose":

      Prompt: "Execute tasks [task numbers/names] from plan at [plan path].

      **Context:**
      - Read the full plan for objective, context files, and deviation rules
      - You are executing a SEGMENT of this plan (not the full plan)
      - Other segments will be executed separately

      **Your responsibilities:**
      - Execute only the tasks assigned to you
      - Follow all deviation rules and authentication gate protocols
      - Track deviations for later Summary
      - DO NOT create SUMMARY.md (will be created after all segments complete)
      - DO NOT commit (will be done after all segments complete)

      **Report back:**
      - Tasks completed
      - Files created/modified
      - Deviations encountered
      - Any issues or blockers"

      Wait for subagent to complete
      Capture results (files changed, deviations, etc.)
      ```

   C. If routing = Main context:
      Execute tasks in main using standard execution flow (step name="execute")
      Track results locally

   D. After segment completes (whether subagent or main):
      Continue to next checkpoint/segment

3. After ALL segments complete:

   A. Aggregate results from all segments:
      - Collect files created/modified from all segments
      - Collect deviations from all segments
      - Collect decisions from all checkpoints
      - Merge into complete picture

   B. Create SUMMARY.md:
      - Use aggregated results
      - Document all work from all segments
      - Include deviations from all segments
      - Note which segments were subagented

   C. Commit:
      - Stage all files from all segments
      - Stage SUMMARY.md
      - Commit with message following plan guidance
      - Include note about segmented execution if relevant

   D. Report completion

**Example execution trace:**

```
Plan: 01-02-PLAN.md (8 tasks, 2 verify checkpoints)

Parsing segments...
- Segment 1: Tasks 1-3 (autonomous)
- Checkpoint 4: human-verify
- Segment 2: Tasks 5-6 (autonomous)
- Checkpoint 7: human-verify
- Segment 3: Task 8 (autonomous)

Routing analysis:
- Segment 1: No prior checkpoint → SUBAGENT ✓
- Checkpoint 4: Verify only → MAIN (required)
- Segment 2: After verify → SUBAGENT ✓
- Checkpoint 7: Verify only → MAIN (required)
- Segment 3: After verify → SUBAGENT ✓

Execution:
[1] Spawning subagent for tasks 1-3...
    → Subagent completes: 3 files modified, 0 deviations
[2] Executing checkpoint 4 (human-verify)...
    ════════════════════════════════════════
    CHECKPOINT: Verification Required
    Task 4 of 8: Verify database schema
    I built: User and Session tables with relations
    How to verify: Check src/db/schema.ts for correct types
    ════════════════════════════════════════
    User: "approved"
[3] Spawning subagent for tasks 5-6...
    → Subagent completes: 2 files modified, 1 deviation (added error handling)
[4] Executing checkpoint 7 (human-verify)...
    User: "approved"
[5] Spawning subagent for task 8...
    → Subagent completes: 1 file modified, 0 deviations

Aggregating results...
- Total files: 6 modified
- Total deviations: 1
- Segmented execution: 3 subagents, 2 checkpoints

Creating SUMMARY.md...
Committing...
✓ Complete
```

**Benefits of this pattern:**
- Main context usage: ~20% (just orchestration + checkpoints)
- Subagent 1: Fresh 0-30% (tasks 1-3)
- Subagent 2: Fresh 0-30% (tasks 5-6)
- Subagent 3: Fresh 0-20% (task 8)
- All autonomous work: Peak quality
- Can handle large plans with many tasks if properly segmented

**When NOT to use segmentation:**
- Plan has decision/human-action checkpoints that affect following tasks
- Following tasks depend on checkpoint outcome
- Better to execute in main sequentially in those cases
</step>

<step name="load_prompt">
Read the plan prompt:
```bash
cat .planning/phases/XX-name/{phase}-{plan}-PLAN.md
```

This IS the execution instructions. Follow it exactly.
</step>

<step name="previous_phase_check">
Before executing, check if previous phase had issues:

```bash
# Find previous phase summary
ls .planning/phases/*/SUMMARY.md 2>/dev/null | sort -r | head -2 | tail -1
```

If previous phase SUMMARY.md has "Issues Encountered" != "None" or "Next Phase Readiness" mentions blockers:

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Previous Issues"
- question: "Previous phase had unresolved items: [summary]. How to proceed?"
- options:
  - "Proceed anyway" - Issues won't block this phase
  - "Address first" - Let's resolve before continuing
  - "Review previous" - Show me the full summary
</step>

<step name="execute">
Execute each task in the prompt. **Deviations are normal** - handle them automatically using embedded rules below.

1. Read the @context files listed in the prompt

2. For each task:

   **If `type="auto"`:**
   - Work toward task completion
   - **If CLI/API returns authentication error:** Handle as authentication gate (see below)
   - **When you discover additional work not in plan:** Apply deviation rules (see below) automatically
   - Continue implementing, applying rules as needed
   - Run the verification
   - Confirm done criteria met
   - Track any deviations for Summary documentation
   - Continue to next task

   **If `type="checkpoint:*"`:**
   - STOP immediately (do not continue to next task)
   - Execute checkpoint_protocol (see below)
   - Wait for user response
   - Verify if possible (check files, env vars, etc.)
   - Only after user confirmation: continue to next task

3. Run overall verification checks from `<verification>` section
4. Confirm all success criteria from `<success_criteria>` section met
5. Document all deviations in Summary (automatic - see deviation_documentation below)
</step>

<authentication_gates>
## Handling Authentication Errors During Execution

**When you encounter authentication errors during `type="auto"` task execution:**

This is NOT a failure. Authentication gates are expected and normal. Handle them dynamically:

**Authentication error indicators:**
- CLI returns: "Error: Not authenticated", "Not logged in", "Unauthorized", "401", "403"
- API returns: "Authentication required", "Invalid API key", "Missing credentials"
- Command fails with: "Please run {tool} login" or "Set {ENV_VAR} environment variable"

**Authentication gate protocol:**

1. **Recognize it's an auth gate** - Not a bug, just needs credentials
2. **STOP current task execution** - Don't retry repeatedly
3. **Create dynamic checkpoint:human-action** - Present it to user immediately
4. **Provide exact authentication steps** - CLI commands, where to get keys
5. **Wait for user to authenticate** - Let them complete auth flow
6. **Verify authentication works** - Test that credentials are valid
7. **Retry the original task** - Resume automation where you left off
8. **Continue normally** - Don't treat this as an error in Summary

**Example: Vercel deployment hits auth error**

```
Task 3: Deploy to Vercel
Running: vercel --yes

Error: Not authenticated. Please run 'vercel login'

[Create checkpoint dynamically]

════════════════════════════════════════
CHECKPOINT: Authentication Required
════════════════════════════════════════

Task 3 of 8: Authenticate Vercel CLI

I tried to deploy but got authentication error.

What you need to do:
Run: vercel login

This will open your browser - complete the authentication flow.

I'll verify after: vercel whoami returns your account

Type "done" when authenticated
════════════════════════════════════════

[Wait for user response]

[User types "done"]

Verifying authentication...
Running: vercel whoami
✓ Authenticated as: user@example.com

Retrying deployment...
Running: vercel --yes
✓ Deployed to: https://myapp-abc123.vercel.app

Task 3 complete. Continuing to task 4...
```

**Example: Stripe API needs key**

```
Task 5: Create Stripe webhook endpoint
Using Stripe API...

Error: 401 Unauthorized - No API key provided

[Create checkpoint dynamically]

════════════════════════════════════════
CHECKPOINT: Credentials Required
════════════════════════════════════════

Task 5 of 8: Provide Stripe API key

I tried to create webhook but need your Stripe API key.

What you need to do:
1. Visit dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
2. Copy your "Secret key" (starts with sk_test_ or sk_live_)
3. Paste it here, or run: export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_...

I'll verify after: Stripe API call succeeds

Type "done" when ready, or paste the key
════════════════════════════════════════

[Wait for user response]

[User pastes key or exports env var]

Saving key to .env...
Verifying Stripe API access...
✓ Stripe API authenticated

Retrying webhook creation...
✓ Webhook endpoint created: whsec_abc123

Task 5 complete. Continuing to task 6...
```

**In Summary documentation:**

Document authentication gates as normal flow, not deviations:

```markdown
## Authentication Gates

During execution, I encountered authentication requirements:

1. Task 3: Vercel CLI required authentication
   - Paused for `vercel login`
   - Resumed after authentication
   - Deployed successfully

2. Task 5: Stripe API required API key
   - Paused for API key input
   - Saved to .env
   - Resumed webhook creation

These are normal gates, not errors.
```

**Key principles:**
- Authentication gates are NOT failures or bugs
- They're expected interaction points during first-time setup
- Handle them gracefully and continue automation after unblocked
- Don't mark tasks as "failed" or "incomplete" due to auth gates
- Document them as normal flow, separate from deviations

See references/cli-automation.md "Authentication Gates" section for complete examples.
</authentication_gates>

<step name="execute">

<deviation_rules>
## Automatic Deviation Handling

**While executing tasks, you WILL discover work not in the plan.** This is normal.

Apply these rules automatically. Track all deviations for Summary documentation.

---

**RULE 1: Auto-fix bugs**

**Trigger:** Code doesn't work as intended (broken behavior, incorrect output, errors)

**Action:** Fix immediately, track for Summary

**Examples:**
- Wrong SQL query returning incorrect data
- Logic errors (inverted condition, off-by-one, infinite loop)
- Type errors, null pointer exceptions, undefined references
- Broken validation (accepts invalid input, rejects valid input)
- Security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, insecure auth)
- Race conditions, deadlocks
- Memory leaks, resource leaks

**Process:**
1. Fix the bug inline
2. Add/update tests to prevent regression
3. Verify fix works
4. Continue task
5. Track in deviations list: `[Rule 1 - Bug] [description]`

**No user permission needed.** Bugs must be fixed for correct operation.

---

**RULE 2: Auto-add missing critical functionality**

**Trigger:** Code is missing essential features for correctness, security, or basic operation

**Action:** Add immediately, track for Summary

**Examples:**
- Missing error handling (no try/catch, unhandled promise rejections)
- No input validation (accepts malicious data, type coercion issues)
- Missing null/undefined checks (crashes on edge cases)
- No authentication on protected routes
- Missing authorization checks (users can access others' data)
- No CSRF protection, missing CORS configuration
- No rate limiting on public APIs
- Missing required database indexes (causes timeouts)
- No logging for errors (can't debug production)

**Process:**
1. Add the missing functionality inline
2. Add tests for the new functionality
3. Verify it works
4. Continue task
5. Track in deviations list: `[Rule 2 - Missing Critical] [description]`

**Critical = required for correct/secure/performant operation**
**No user permission needed.** These are not "features" - they're requirements for basic correctness.

---

**RULE 3: Auto-fix blocking issues**

**Trigger:** Something prevents you from completing current task

**Action:** Fix immediately to unblock, track for Summary

**Examples:**
- Missing dependency (package not installed, import fails)
- Wrong types blocking compilation
- Broken import paths (file moved, wrong relative path)
- Missing environment variable (app won't start)
- Database connection config error
- Build configuration error (webpack, tsconfig, etc.)
- Missing file referenced in code
- Circular dependency blocking module resolution

**Process:**
1. Fix the blocking issue
2. Verify task can now proceed
3. Continue task
4. Track in deviations list: `[Rule 3 - Blocking] [description]`

**No user permission needed.** Can't complete task without fixing blocker.

---

**RULE 4: Ask about architectural changes**

**Trigger:** Fix/addition requires significant structural modification

**Action:** STOP, present to user, wait for decision

**Examples:**
- Adding new database table (not just column)
- Major schema changes (changing primary key, splitting tables)
- Introducing new service layer or architectural pattern
- Switching libraries/frameworks (React → Vue, REST → GraphQL)
- Changing authentication approach (sessions → JWT)
- Adding new infrastructure (message queue, cache layer, CDN)
- Changing API contracts (breaking changes to endpoints)
- Adding new deployment environment

**Process:**
1. STOP current task
2. Present clearly:
```
⚠️ Architectural Decision Needed

Current task: [task name]
Discovery: [what you found that prompted this]
Proposed change: [architectural modification]
Why needed: [rationale]
Impact: [what this affects - APIs, deployment, dependencies, etc.]
Alternatives: [other approaches, or "none apparent"]

Proceed with proposed change? (yes / different approach / defer)
```
3. WAIT for user response
4. If approved: implement, track as `[Rule 4 - Architectural] [description]`
5. If different approach: discuss and implement
6. If deferred: log to ISSUES.md, continue without change

**User decision required.** These changes affect system design.

---

**RULE 5: Log non-critical enhancements**

**Trigger:** Improvement that would enhance code but isn't essential now

**Action:** Add to .planning/ISSUES.md automatically, continue task

**Examples:**
- Performance optimization (works correctly, just slower than ideal)
- Code refactoring (works, but could be cleaner/DRY-er)
- Better naming (works, but variables could be clearer)
- Organizational improvements (works, but file structure could be better)
- Nice-to-have UX improvements (works, but could be smoother)
- Additional test coverage beyond basics (basics exist, could be more thorough)
- Documentation improvements (code works, docs could be better)
- Accessibility enhancements beyond minimum

**Process:**
1. Create .planning/ISSUES.md if doesn't exist (use template)
2. Add entry with ISS-XXX number (auto-increment)
3. Brief notification: `📋 Logged enhancement: [brief] (ISS-XXX)`
4. Continue task without implementing

**Template for ISSUES.md:**
```markdown
# Project Issues Log

Enhancements discovered during execution. Not critical - address in future phases.

## Open Enhancements

### ISS-001: [Brief description]
- **Discovered:** Phase [X] Plan [Y] Task [Z] (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Type:** [Performance / Refactoring / UX / Testing / Documentation / Accessibility]
- **Description:** [What could be improved and why it would help]
- **Impact:** Low (works correctly, this would enhance)
- **Effort:** [Quick / Medium / Substantial]
- **Suggested phase:** [Phase number or "Future"]

## Closed Enhancements

[Moved here when addressed]
```

**No user permission needed.** Logging for future consideration.

---

**RULE PRIORITY (when multiple could apply):**

1. **If Rule 4 applies** → STOP and ask (architectural decision)
2. **If Rules 1-3 apply** → Fix automatically, track for Summary
3. **If Rule 5 applies** → Log to ISSUES.md, continue
4. **If genuinely unsure which rule** → Apply Rule 4 (ask user)

**Edge case guidance:**
- "This validation is missing" → Rule 2 (critical for security)
- "This validation could be better" → Rule 5 (enhancement)
- "This crashes on null" → Rule 1 (bug)
- "This could be faster" → Rule 5 (enhancement) UNLESS actually timing out → Rule 2 (critical)
- "Need to add table" → Rule 4 (architectural)
- "Need to add column" → Rule 1 or 2 (depends: fixing bug or adding critical field)

**When in doubt:** Ask yourself "Does this affect correctness, security, or ability to complete task?"
- YES → Rules 1-3 (fix automatically)
- NO → Rule 5 (log it)
- MAYBE → Rule 4 (ask user)

</deviation_rules>

<deviation_documentation>
## Documenting Deviations in Summary

After all tasks complete, Summary MUST include deviations section.

**If no deviations:**
```markdown
## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.
```

**If deviations occurred:**
```markdown
## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 1 - Bug] Fixed case-sensitive email uniqueness constraint**
- **Found during:** Task 4 (Follow/unfollow API implementation)
- **Issue:** User.email unique constraint was case-sensitive - Test@example.com and test@example.com were both allowed, causing duplicate accounts
- **Fix:** Changed to `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX users_email_unique ON users (LOWER(email))`
- **Files modified:** src/models/User.ts, migrations/003_fix_email_unique.sql
- **Verification:** Unique constraint test passes - duplicate emails properly rejected
- **Commit:** abc123f

**2. [Rule 2 - Missing Critical] Added JWT expiry validation to auth middleware**
- **Found during:** Task 3 (Protected route implementation)
- **Issue:** Auth middleware wasn't checking token expiry - expired tokens were being accepted
- **Fix:** Added exp claim validation in middleware, reject with 401 if expired
- **Files modified:** src/middleware/auth.ts, src/middleware/auth.test.ts
- **Verification:** Expired token test passes - properly rejects with 401
- **Commit:** def456g

**3. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Fixed broken import path for UserService**
- **Found during:** Task 5 (Profile endpoint)
- **Issue:** Import path referenced old location (src/services/User.ts) but file was moved to src/services/users/UserService.ts in previous plan
- **Fix:** Updated import path
- **Files modified:** src/api/profile.ts
- **Verification:** Build succeeds, imports resolve
- **Commit:** ghi789h

**4. [Rule 4 - Architectural] Added Redis caching layer (APPROVED BY USER)**
- **Found during:** Task 6 (Feed endpoint)
- **Issue:** Feed queries hitting database on every request, causing 2-3 second response times under load
- **Proposed:** Add Redis cache with 5-minute TTL for feed data
- **User decision:** Approved
- **Fix:** Implemented Redis caching with ioredis client, cache invalidation on new posts
- **Files created:** src/cache/RedisCache.ts, src/cache/CacheKeys.ts, docker-compose.yml (added Redis)
- **Verification:** Feed response time reduced to <200ms, cache hit rate >80% in testing
- **Commit:** jkl012m

### Deferred Enhancements

Logged to .planning/ISSUES.md for future consideration:
- ISS-001: Refactor UserService into smaller modules (discovered in Task 3)
- ISS-002: Add connection pooling for Redis (discovered in Task 6)
- ISS-003: Improve error messages for validation failures (discovered in Task 2)

---

**Total deviations:** 4 auto-fixed (1 bug, 1 missing critical, 1 blocking, 1 architectural with approval), 3 deferred
**Impact on plan:** All auto-fixes necessary for correctness/security/performance. No scope creep.
```

**This provides complete transparency:**
- Every deviation documented
- Why it was needed
- What rule applied
- What was done
- User can see exactly what happened beyond the plan

Update ROADMAP.md:

**If more plans remain in this phase:**
- Update plan count: "2/3 plans complete"
- Keep phase status as "In progress"

**If this was the last plan in the phase:**
- Mark phase complete: status → "Complete"
- Add completion date
- Update plan count: "3/3 plans complete"
</step>

<step name="git_commit_plan">
Commit plan completion (PLAN + SUMMARY + code):

```bash
git add .planning/phases/XX-name/{phase}-{plan}-PLAN.md
git add .planning/phases/XX-name/{phase}-{plan}-SUMMARY.md
git add .planning/ROADMAP.md
git add src/  # or relevant code directories
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat({phase}-{plan}): [one-liner from SUMMARY.md]

- [Key accomplishment 1]
- [Key accomplishment 2]
- [Key accomplishment 3]
EOF
)"
```

Confirm: "Committed: feat({phase}-{plan}): [what shipped]"

**Commit scope pattern:**
- `feat(01-01):` for phase 1 plan 1
- `feat(02-03):` for phase 2 plan 3
- Creates clear, chronological git history

<step name="offer_next">
**If more plans in this phase:**
```
Plan {phase}-{plan} complete.
Summary: .planning/phases/XX-name/{phase}-{plan}-SUMMARY.md

[X] of [Y] plans complete for Phase Z.

What's next?
1. Execute next plan ({phase}-{next-plan})
2. Review what was built
3. Done for now
```

**If phase complete (last plan done):**
```
Plan {phase}-{plan} complete.
Summary: .planning/phases/XX-name/{phase}-{plan}-SUMMARY.md

Phase [Z]: [Name] COMPLETE - all [Y] plans finished.

What's next?
1. Transition to next phase
2. Review phase accomplishments
3. Done for now
