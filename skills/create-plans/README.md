# create-plans

**Hierarchical project planning optimized for solo developer + Claude**

Create executable plans that Claude can run, not enterprise documentation that sits unused.

## Philosophy

**You are the visionary. Claude is the builder.**

No teams. No stakeholders. No ceremonies. No coordination overhead.

Plans are written AS prompts (PLAN.md IS the execution prompt), not documentation that gets transformed into prompts later.

## Quick Start

```
Skill("create-plans")
```

The skill will:
1. Scan for existing planning structure
2. Check for git repo (offers to initialize)
3. Present context-aware options
4. Guide you through the appropriate workflow

## Planning Hierarchy

```
BRIEF.md          → Human vision (what and why)
    ↓
ROADMAP.md        → Phase structure (high-level plan)
    ↓
RESEARCH.md       → Research prompt (for unknowns - optional)
    ↓
FINDINGS.md       → Research output (if research done)
    ↓
PLAN.md           → THE PROMPT (Claude executes this)
    ↓
SUMMARY.md        → Outcome (existence = phase complete)
```

## Directory Structure

All planning artifacts go in `.planning/`:

```
.planning/
├── BRIEF.md                    # Project vision
├── ROADMAP.md                  # Phase structure + tracking
└── phases/
    ├── 01-foundation/
    │   ├── PLAN.md             # THE PROMPT (execute this)
    │   ├── SUMMARY.md          # Outcome (exists = done)
    │   └── .continue-here.md   # Handoff (temporary)
    └── 02-auth/
        ├── RESEARCH.md         # Research prompt (if needed)
        ├── FINDINGS.md         # Research output
        ├── PLAN.md             # Execute prompt
        └── SUMMARY.md
```

## Workflows

### Starting a New Project

1. Invoke skill
2. Choose "Start new project"
3. Answer questions about vision/goals
4. Skill creates BRIEF.md
5. Optionally create ROADMAP.md with phases
6. Plan first phase

### Planning a Phase

1. Skill reads BRIEF + ROADMAP
2. Loads domain expertise if applicable (see Domain Skills below)
3. If phase has unknowns → create RESEARCH.md first
4. Creates PLAN.md (the executable prompt)
5. You review or execute

### Executing a Phase

1. Skill reads PLAN.md
2. Executes each task with verification
3. Creates SUMMARY.md when complete
4. Git commits phase completion
5. Offers to plan next phase

### Pausing Work (Handoff)

1. Choose "Create handoff"
2. Skill creates `.continue-here.md` with full context
3. When resuming, skill loads handoff and continues

## Domain Skills (Optional)

**What are domain skills?**

Full-fledged agent skills that exhaustively document how to build in a specific framework/platform. They make your plans concrete instead of generic.

**Without domain skill:**
```
Task: Create authentication system
Action: Implement user login
```
Generic. Not helpful.

**With domain skill (macOS apps):**
```
Task: Create login window
Files: Sources/Views/LoginView.swift
Action: SwiftUI view with @Bindable for User model. TextField for username/password.
SecureField for password (uses system keychain). Submit button triggers validation
logic. Use @FocusState for tab order. Add Command-L keyboard shortcut.
Verify: xcodebuild test && open App.app (check tab order, keychain storage)
```
Specific. Executable. Framework-appropriate.

**Structure of domain skills:**

```
$CODEX_HOME/skills/expertise/[domain]/
├── SKILL.md              # Router + essential principles
├── workflows/            # build-new-app, add-feature, debug-app, etc.
└── references/           # Exhaustive domain knowledge (often 10k+ lines)
```

**Domain skills are dual-purpose:**

1. **Standalone skills** - Invoke with `Skill("build-macos-apps")` for guided development
2. **Context for create-plans** - Loaded automatically when planning that domain

**Example domains:**
- `macos-apps` - Swift/SwiftUI macOS (19 references, 10k+ lines)
- `iphone-apps` - Swift/SwiftUI iOS
- `unity-games` - Unity game development
- `swift-midi-apps` - MIDI/audio apps
- `with-agent-sdk` - Claude Agent SDK apps
- `nextjs-ecommerce` - Next.js e-commerce

**How it works:**

1. Skill infers domain from your request ("build a macOS app" → build-macos-apps)
2. Before creating PLAN.md, reads all `$CODEX_HOME/skills/build/macos-apps/references/*.md`
3. Uses that exhaustive knowledge to write framework-specific tasks
4. Result: Plans that match your actual tech stack with all the details

**What if you don't have domain skills?**

Skill works fine without them - proceeds with general planning. But tasks will be more generic and require more clarification during execution.

### Creating a Domain Skill

Domain skills are created with [create-agent-skills](../create-agent-skills/) skill.

**Process:**

1. `Skill("create-agent-skills")` → choose "Build a new skill"
2. Name: `build-[your-domain]`
3. Description: "Build [framework/platform] apps. Full lifecycle - build, debug, test, optimize, ship."
4. Ask it to create exhaustive references covering:
   - Architecture patterns
   - Project scaffolding
   - Common features (data, networking, UI)
   - Testing and debugging
   - Platform-specific conventions
   - CLI workflow (how to build/run without IDE)
   - Deployment/shipping

**The skill should be comprehensive** - 5k-10k+ lines documenting everything about building in that domain. When create-plans loads it, the resulting PLAN.md tasks will be detailed and executable.

## Quality Controls

Research prompts include systematic verification to prevent gaps:

- **Verification checklists** - Enumerate ALL options before researching
- **Blind spots review** - "What might I have missed?"
- **Critical claims audit** - Verify "X is not possible" with sources
- **Quality reports** - Distinguish verified facts from assumptions
- **Streaming writes** - Write incrementally to prevent token limit failures

See `references/research-pitfalls.md` for known mistakes and prevention.

## Key Principles

### Solo Developer + Claude
Planning for ONE person (you) and ONE implementer (Claude). No team coordination, stakeholder management, or enterprise processes.

### Plans Are Prompts
PLAN.md IS the execution prompt. It contains objective, context (@file references), tasks (Files/Action/Verify/Done), and verification steps.

### Ship Fast, Iterate Fast
Plan → Execute → Ship → Learn → Repeat. No multi-week timelines, approval gates, or sprint ceremonies.

### Context Awareness
Monitors token usage:
- **25% remaining**: Mentions context getting full
- **15% remaining**: Pauses, offers handoff
- **10% remaining**: Auto-creates handoff, stops

Never starts large operations below 15% without confirmation.

### User Gates
Pauses at critical decision points:
- Before writing PLAN.md (confirm breakdown)
- After low-confidence research
- On verification failures
- When previous phase had issues

See `references/user-gates.md` for full gate patterns.

### Git Versioning
All planning artifacts are version controlled. Commits outcomes, not process:
- Initialization commit (BRIEF + ROADMAP)
- Phase completion commits (PLAN + SUMMARY + code)
- Handoff commits (when pausing work)

Git log becomes project history.

## Anti-Patterns

This skill NEVER includes:
- Team structures, roles, RACI matrices
- Stakeholder management, alignment meetings
- Sprint ceremonies, standups, retros
- Multi-week estimates, resource allocation
- Change management, governance processes
- Documentation for documentation's sake

If it sounds like corporate PM theater, it doesn't belong.

- `workflows/create-roadmap.md` - Define phases from brief
- `workflows/plan-phase.md` - Create executable phase prompt
- `workflows/execute-phase.md` - Run phase, create summary
- `workflows/research-phase.md` - Create and run research
- `workflows/plan-chunk.md` - Plan immediate next tasks
- `workflows/transition.md` - Mark phase complete, advance
- `workflows/handoff.md` - Create context handoff for pausing
- `workflows/resume.md` - Load handoff, restore context
- `workflows/get-guidance.md` - Help decide planning approach

## Example Domain Skill

See `build/example-nextjs/` for a minimal domain skill showing:
- Framework-specific patterns
- Project structure conventions
- Common commands
- Phase breakdown strategies
- Task specificity guidelines

Use this as a template for creating your own domain skills.

## Success Criteria

Planning skill succeeds when:
- Context scan runs before intake
- Appropriate workflow selected based on state
- PLAN.md IS the executable prompt (not separate doc)
- Hierarchy is maintained (brief → roadmap → phase)
- Handoffs preserve full context for resumption
- Context limits respected (auto-handoff at 10%)
- Quality controls prevent research gaps
- Streaming writes prevent token limit failures
