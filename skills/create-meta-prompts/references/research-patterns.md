<prompt_template>
```xml
<session_initialization>
Before beginning research, verify today's date:
!`date +%Y-%m-%d`

Use this date when searching for "current" or "latest" information.
Example: If today is 2025-11-22, search for "2025" not "2024".
</session_initialization>

<research_objective>
Research {topic} to inform {subsequent use}.

Purpose: {What decision/implementation this enables}
Scope: {Boundaries of the research}
Output: {topic}-research.md with structured findings
</research_objective>

<include>
{What to investigate}
{Specific questions to answer}

{What to defer to later research}
</exclude>

<sources>
{Priority sources with exact URLs for WebFetch}
Official documentation:
- https://example.com/official-docs
- https://example.com/api-reference

Search queries for WebSearch:
- "{topic} best practices {current_year}"

</research_scope>

<verification_checklist>
{If researching configuration/architecture with known components:}
□ Verify ALL known configuration/implementation options (enumerate below):
  □ Option/Scope 1: {description}
  □ Option/Scope 2: {description}
  □ Option/Scope 3: {description}
□ Document exact file locations/URLs for each option
□ Verify precedence/hierarchy rules if applicable
□ Confirm syntax and examples from official sources
□ Check for recent updates or changes to documentation

{For all research:}
□ Verify negative claims ("X is not possible") with official docs
□ Confirm all primary claims have authoritative sources
□ Check both current docs AND recent updates/changelogs
□ Test multiple search queries to avoid missing information
□ Check for environment/tool-specific variations
</verification_checklist>

<research_quality_assurance>
Before completing research, perform these checks:

<completeness_check>
- [ ] All enumerated options/components documented with evidence
- [ ] Each access method/approach evaluated against ALL requirements
- [ ] Official documentation cited for critical claims
- [ ] Contradictory information resolved or flagged
</completeness_check>

<source_verification>
- [ ] Primary claims backed by official/authoritative sources
- [ ] Version numbers and dates included where relevant
- [ ] Actual URLs provided (not just "search for X")
- [ ] Distinguish verified facts from assumptions
</source_verification>

<blind_spots_review>
Ask yourself: "What might I have missed?"
- [ ] Are there configuration/implementation options I didn't investigate?
- [ ] Did I check for multiple environments/contexts (e.g., Desktop vs Code)?
- [ ] Did I verify claims that seem definitive ("cannot", "only", "must")?
- [ ] Did I look for recent changes or updates to documentation?
</blind_spots_review>

<critical_claims_audit>
For any statement like "X is not possible" or "Y is the only way":
- [ ] Is this verified by official documentation?
- [ ] Have I checked for recent updates that might change this?
- [ ] Are there alternative approaches I haven't considered?
</critical_claims_audit>

</output_structure>

<incremental_output>
**CRITICAL: Write findings incrementally to prevent token limit failures**

Instead of generating the full research in memory and writing at the end:
1. Create the output file with initial structure
2. Write each finding as you discover it
3. Append code examples as you find them
4. Update metadata at the end

This ensures:
- Zero lost work if token limit is hit
- File contains all findings up to that point
- No estimation heuristics needed
- Works for any research size

<workflow>
Step 1 - Initialize structure:
```bash
# Create file with skeleton
Write: .prompts/{num}-{topic}-research/{topic}-research.md
Content: Basic XML structure with empty sections
```

Step 2 - Append findings incrementally:
```bash
# After researching authentication libraries
Edit: Append <finding> to <findings> section

# After discovering rate limits
Edit: Append another <finding> to <findings> section
```

Step 3 - Add code examples as discovered:
```bash
# Found jose example
Edit: Append to <code_examples> section
```

Step 4 - Finalize metadata:
```bash
# After completing research
Edit: Update <metadata> section with confidence, dependencies, etc.
```
</workflow>

<example_prompt_instruction>
```xml
<output_requirements>
Write findings incrementally to {topic}-research.md as you discover them:

1. Create the file with this initial structure:
   ```xml
   <research>
     <summary>[Will complete at end]</summary>
     <findings></findings>
     <recommendations></recommendations>
     <code_examples></code_examples>
     <metadata></metadata>
   </research>
   ```

2. As you research each aspect, immediately append findings:
   - Research JWT libraries → Write finding
   - Discover security pattern → Write finding
   - Find code example → Append to code_examples

3. After all research complete:
   - Write summary (synthesize all findings)
   - Write recommendations (based on findings)
   - Write metadata (confidence, dependencies, etc.)

This incremental approach ensures all work is saved even if execution
hits token limits. Never generate the full output in memory first.
</output_requirements>
```
</example_prompt_instruction>

<benefits>
**vs. Pre-execution estimation:**
- No estimation errors (you don't predict, you just write)
- No artificial modularization (agent decides natural breakpoints)
- No lost work (everything written is saved)

**vs. Single end-of-execution write:**
- Survives token limit failures (partial progress saved)
- Lower memory usage (write as you go)
- Natural checkpoint recovery (can continue from last finding)
</benefits>
</incremental_output>

<summary_requirements>
Create `.prompts/{num}-{topic}-research/SUMMARY.md`

Load template: [summary-template.md](summary-template.md)

For research, emphasize key recommendation and decision readiness. Next step typically: Create plan.
</summary_requirements>

<success_criteria>
- All scope questions answered
- All verification checklist items completed
- Sources are current and authoritative
- Findings are actionable
- Metadata captures gaps honestly
- Quality report distinguishes verified from assumed
- SUMMARY.md created with substantive one-liner
- Ready for planning/implementation to consume

<key_principles>

<structure_for_consumption>
The next Codex needs to quickly extract relevant information:
```xml
<finding category="authentication">
  <title>JWT vs Session Tokens</title>
  <detail>
    JWTs are preferred for stateless APIs. Sessions better for
    traditional web apps with server-side rendering.
  </detail>
  <source>OWASP Authentication Cheatsheet 2024</source>
  <relevance>
    Our API-first architecture points to JWT approach.
  </relevance>
</finding>
```
</structure_for_consumption>

<include_code_examples>
The implementation prompt needs patterns to follow:
```xml
<code_examples>
<example name="jwt-verification">
```typescript
import { jwtVerify } from 'jose';

const { payload } = await jwtVerify(
  token,
  new TextEncoder().encode(secret),
  { algorithms: ['HS256'] }
);
```
Source: jose library documentation
</example>
</code_examples>
```
</include_code_examples>

<explicit_confidence>
Help the next Codex know what to trust:
```xml
<metadata>
  <confidence level="medium">
    API documentation is comprehensive but lacks real-world
    performance benchmarks. Rate limits are documented but
    actual behavior may differ under load.
  </confidence>

  <quality_report>
    <confidence_by_finding>
      - JWT library comparison: High (npm stats + security audits + active maintenance verified)
      - Performance benchmarks: Low (no official data, community reports vary)
      - Rate limits: Medium (documented but not tested)
    </confidence_by_finding>
  </quality_report>
</metadata>
```
</explicit_confidence>

<enumerate_known_possibilities>
When researching systems with known components, enumerate them explicitly:
```xml
<verification_checklist>
**CRITICAL**: Verify ALL configuration scopes:
□ User scope - Global configuration
□ Project scope - Project-level configuration files
□ Local scope - Project-specific user overrides
□ Environment scope - Environment variable based
</verification_checklist>
```

This forces systematic coverage and prevents omissions.
